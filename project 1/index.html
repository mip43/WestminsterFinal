	Designed and originally published by Leo Maggs, Westminster (typeface) remains a distinctive type from the 1960s/ 70s, synonymous with the high-tech design of the newly computerized society. Maggs was working at Hazell Sun Group’s Design Studio in Covent Garden, London when he was assigned to design a title with a futuristic style for an article in the company’s magazine, About the House.

<div id='body2'><p>
	His design was largely based on the lettering system used on bank cheques: MICR (magnetic ink character recognition) system, E-13B. E-13B was most functional for its ability to be recognized by simple magnetic readers of the time, however limited in that it only contained 14-characters.

<div id='body3'><p>
	Inspired by a tech-based font, Westminster took on a very digital feel with its pixel-like structure. It was fitting for the task and pointed to the computerization of society, implying mechanical industrialization and futuristic landscape. After completing the design of the Westminster alphabet, Letraset declined his design but later published their own version, Data 70.
